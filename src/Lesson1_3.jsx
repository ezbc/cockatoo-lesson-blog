            <p>– In your own words, what does it mean to be curious about something?
                <br/>– What’s one thing that you were curious
                to learn more about recently (this doesn’t need to be coding-related)? How did you learn more about
                it?<br/>–
                What’s one best practice you’ve learned in your first few weeks at CTD that you don’t know “the why”
                behind?
                How can you find out “the why”?
